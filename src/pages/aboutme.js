                Hi! As this webpage would suggest, my name is Ryann Goldberg.
                I am a UNC Chapel Hill grad who has dabbled in a few different career paths, as a self-proclaimed jack of all trades. 
                I have been in law, sales, and hospitality and, as a result, am particularly skilled at multi-tasking and problem-solving. 
                I have set my sights on coding for a new skillset and career, as it most appeals to my left-sided brain.
